Criteria usually set minimum conditions (e.g. limits, intervals, thresholds, etc.) that need to be met in order to pass the requirements or to fulfil them to a certain degree or quality. The concept of Criteria is broader than the concept of Constraint since it covers more usages. The evaluation of the fulfilment is usually supported by the provision of Evidence. \nFor example in the eProcurement domain, the eProcurement Ontology defines different subclasses of Criterion such as exclusion grounds, selection criteria or award criteria. A concrete example of a Criterion is 'participation in a criminal organisation' which could also be considered as an exclusion ground criterion in the procurement domain or for requiring a public service."

The response to an Information Requirement is an Evidence when the issuer of the response is an authoritative source (e.g. a Civil Registry providing data about a natural person for the provision of public service through the Single Digital Gateway). In other cases, the responses might not be issued by an authoritative source, but the issuer supports the responses with Evidences (or commits to support them timely, e.g. a self-declaration or a declaration of oath). The Information Requirement can require structured data or documents of any form. For structured data, the Requirement can use 'Concepts' to specify the structure and type of the data expected in the response. For both structured and unstructured data, the Information Requirement can indicate the expected Type of Evidence, its format, source, and other properties related to the Evidence."
