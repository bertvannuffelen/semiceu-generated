Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that do not conform to the stated national standard. At the time of publication, work is progressing on <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html\">ISO 19160-1</a> that defines a method through which different Addresses can be converted from one conceptual model to another.\r\n</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis specification was heavily based on the INSPIRE Address Representation data type. It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very granular set of\r\nproperties, we add two further properties:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>- full address (the complete address as a formatted string)</li>\r\n  <li>- addressID (a unique identifier for the address)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one string, with or without formatting. This is analogous to <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2006/vcard/ns#label\">vCard's label property</a>.\r\n</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe addressID is part of the INSPIRE guidelines and provides a hook that can be used to link the Address to an alternative representation, such as vCard or OASIS xAL.\r\n</p>",

Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once.
