Taking the example used in the INSPIRE document (page 15), the following are all valid geographic names for the Greek capital:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>- \"A?n?a\"@gr-Grek (the Greek endonym written in the Greek script)</li>\r\n  <li>- \"Athína\"@gr-Latn (the standard Romanisation of the endonym)</li>\r\n  <li>- \"Athens\"@en (the English language exonym)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nINSPIRE has a detailed (XML-based) method of providing metadata about a geographic name and in XML-data sets that may be the most appropriate method to follow. When using the Core Location Vocabulary in data sets that are not focussed on environmental/geographical\r\ndata (the use case for INSPIRE), the Code datatype or a simple language identifier may be used to provide such metadata.\r\n</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe country codes defined in <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html\">ISO 3166</a> may be used as geographic names and these are generally preferred over either the long form or short form of a country's name (as they are less error prone). The Publications Office of the European Union recommends the use of ISO 3166-1 codes for countries in all cases except two:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>- use 'UK' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GB for the United Kingdom;</li>\r\n  <li>- use 'EL' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GR for Greece.</li>\r\nWhere a country has changed its name or no longer exists (such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia etc.) use the ISO 3166-3 code.\r\n</p>\r",
