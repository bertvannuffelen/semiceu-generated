For example, http://sws.geonames.org/593116/ identifies the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. Unfortunately these URIs cannot easily be automatically deduced since the URI scheme uses simple numeric codes. Finding a GeoNames identifier for a Location is almost always a manual process. Where such identifiers are known or can be found, however, it is recommended that they be used.\r\n</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhere the Location Class is used to identify a country, if the geonames URI is not known, the recommendation is to use DBpedia URIs of the form http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:XX where XX is the ISO 3166 two character code for the country.\r\n</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe EU's Publication Office diverges from ISO 3166-1 and uses EL and UK for Greece and the United Kingdom respectively. DBpedia sticks to\r\nthe ISO codes and so the correct URIs for these countries are:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>- http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:GR</li>\r\n  <li>- http://dbpedia.org/resource/ISO_3166-1:GB</li>\r\n<ul>\r\neven when the geographic name is given as EL or UK.\r\n</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe use of a URIs has added advantages:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>- it can be used by automated systems to look up additional data (linked data);</li>\r\n  <li>- a triple store may store only one copy of the URI, whereas if a string is used, a copy of that string is always stored for each and every person in the database. Thus, in large data sets, the saving on memory capacity and the improvement in transmission efficiency can be substantial.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>"

This is beyond what is necessary for the Core Location Vocabulary but, importantly, the concept of a geographic name used here is consistent.</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA geographic name is a proper noun applied to a spatial object. Taking the example used in the INSPIRE document (page 15), the following are all valid geographic names for the Greek capital:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>- \"A?n?a\"@gr-Grek (the Greek endonym written in the Greek script)</li>\r\n  <li>- \"Athína\"@gr-Latn (the standard Romanisation of the endonym)</li>\r\n  <li>- \"Athens\"@en (the English language exonym)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nINSPIRE has a detailed (XML-based) method of providing metadata about a geographic name and in XML-data sets that may be the most appropriate method to follow. When using the Core Location Vocabulary in data sets that are not focussed on environmental/geographical\r\ndata (the use case for INSPIRE), the Code datatype or a simple language identifier may be used to provide such metadata.\r\n</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe country codes defined in <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html\">ISO 3166</a> may be used as geographic names and these are generally preferred over either the long form or short form of a country's name (as they are less error prone). The Publications Office of the European Union recommends the use of ISO 3166-1 codes for countries in all cases except two:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>- use 'UK' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GB for the United Kingdom;</li>\r\n  <li>- use 'EL' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GR for Greece.</li>\r\nWhere a country has changed its name or no longer exists (such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia etc.) use the ISO 3166-3 code.\r\n</p>\r"

Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that do not conform to the stated national standard. At the time of publication, work is progressing on <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html\">ISO 19160-1</a> that defines a method through which different Addresses can be converted from one conceptual model to another.\r\n</p></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis specification was heavily based on the INSPIRE Address Representation data type. It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very granular set of\r\nproperties, we add two further properties:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>- full address (the complete address as a formatted string)</li>\r\n  <li>- addressID (a unique identifier for the address)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one string, with or without formatting.

            "en": "<p>\r\nThe concept of adding a globally unique identifier for each instance of an address is a crucial part of the INSPIRE data spec. A number of EU countries have already implemented an ID (a UUID) in their Address Register/gazetteer, among them Denmark. OASIS xAL also includes an\r\naddress identifier. It is the address Identifier that allows an address to be represented in a format other than INSPIRE whilst remaining conformant to the Core Vocabulary.\r\n</p></br>\r\n<p>\r\nThe INSPIRE method of representing addresses is very detailed, designed primarily for use in databases of addresses. Whilst data that is published in full conformance with the INSPIRE data structure can be made available using the Location Core Vocabulary the reverse is not true since the Core Vocabulary allows much greater flexibility.\r\n</p></br>\r\n<p>\r\nMany datasets that include address data as one piece of information about something else are likely to have that data in simpler formats. These might be tailored to the specific need of the dataset, follow a national norm, or make use of a standard like vCard.\r\n</p></br>\r\n<p>\r\nTo provide maximum flexibility in the Core Vocabulary, whilst remaining interoperable with INSPIRE Address Guidelines (which EU Member States are obliged to use), the Location Core Vocabulary provides the extra property of full address and makes use of INSPIRE's addressID.\r\n</p>"
