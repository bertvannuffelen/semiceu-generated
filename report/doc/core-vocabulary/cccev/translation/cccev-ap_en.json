The concept of Criteria is broader than the concept of Constraint since it covers more usages. The evaluation of the fulfilment is usually supported by the provision of Evidence. \nIn the eProcurement domain, the eProcurement Ontology defines different subclasses of Criterion such as exclusion grounds, selection criteria or award criteria. \n\nA concrete example of a Criterion is 'participation in a criminal organisation' which could also be considered as an exclusion ground criterion in the procurement domain or for requiring a public service."

This process can be executed by the Evidence provider. In that case the Evidence provider can supply the Value as is. But it can also be executed by the Requirement processor. If the Requirement processor can process the business information of the supplied Evidence then the Requirement processor can query for the information itself. In CCCEV, the latter case is supported by the query attribute for a Supported Value. So instead of providing a Value, a query on the data is supplied.\n\nAs described in the Evidence class, CCCEV does not impose how the actual information contained in an Evidence must be exchanged and processed in order to fulfill a Requirement. The combination of Supported Value and Information Concept, is one of the approaches that CCCEV supports."
